PlayerHeatMap is a simple script that prints test results in a colored matrix and saves it as a png, using Octave.

Input text files should be several rows on the form "X Y VALUE", like so

12 34 56
13 34 40
12 35 58
13 35 60

This describes a 2x2 matrix [56 40;58 60] typically written by some measurement script. The original measurement was the number of players that our server could handle given different constraints and parameters, hence the name playerheatmap.
